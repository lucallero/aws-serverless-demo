# Simple AWS AppSync app demo with serverless framework 

Main purpose is to show deploy of AppSync with serverless framework.

Dynamo table is not being created yet. I should update serverless.yaml to include table creation soon.

## Before you start..

You shoud have you aws-cli installed with your credentials. For tutorial on this check AWS docs, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html and serverless docs https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/

This is all based on sid88in tutorials, https://github.com/sid88in/serverless-appsync-plugin.
